# Welcome to Jekyll!
#
# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

       Hello! My name is Bhargava. My interests are technology, programming, 
       and music. On this site, I plan to document things that I find are useful
       to me, and are probably helpful to others as well. 


       I also plan to make posts about internet culture and music.

# baseurl: "/blog" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
# url: "http://127.0.0.1:4444/" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com
